open Req

(** [https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/explain/]

    Wondering why a specific document ranks higher (or lower) for a query?
    You can use the explain API for an explanation of how the relevance
    score (_score) is calculated for every result.

    OpenSearch uses a probabilistic ranking framework called Okapi BM25 to
    calculate relevance scores. Okapi BM25 is based on the original TF/IDF
    framework used by Apache Lucene.

    Note: The explain API is an expensive operation in terms of both
    resources and time. On production clusters, we recommend using it
    sparingly for the purpose of troubleshooting.*)

    failures (for example, querying a text field for an integer). Default
    is false. *)

(** Specifies a preference of which shard to retrieve results from.
    Available options are _local, which tells the operation to retrieve
    results from a locally allocated shard replica, and a custom string
    value assigned to a specific shard replica. By default, OpenSearch
    executes the explain operation on random shards. *)

    index rather than the documentâ€™s _source. Default is false. *)
